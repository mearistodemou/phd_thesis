2. The simulation script for the 3lvl and standard DSEMs is "dsem_sim_3lvl_thesis.R".
3. The simulation script for the bivariate DSEM is "dsem_sim_bv_thesis.R".
4. The scripts to create figures and tables found in Chapter 3 are "ch2_figures.R" and "ch2_tables.R", respectively.
5. The script to compute within-person standardized effects for the DSEMs is "func_wp_std_dsem.R".
